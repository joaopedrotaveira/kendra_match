# Kendra Match

Kendra Match will include a set of modules for use with the [Drupal 7](http://drupal.org/) [Recommender API](http://drupal.org/project/recommender). Used together with [Apache Mahout](http://mahout.apache.org/), an open source software library for machine learning and data mining, Kendra Match consists of components for user profile data aggregation and a system for reasoning about user interests and preferences.

Kendra Match is free software developed by Kendra Foundation in collaboration with [SARACEN](http://saracen-p2p.eu/) and co-funded by the European Union under the Seventh Framework programme.
